## INTRODUCTION

rJSmin is a javascript minifier written in python.

The minifier is based on the semantics of [jsmin.c by Douglas
Crockford](http://www.crockford.com/javascript/jsmin.c).

The module is a re-implementation aiming for speed, so it can be used at
runtime (rather than during a preprocessing step). Usually it produces the
same results as the original ``jsmin.c``. It differs in the following ways:

- there is no error detection: unterminated string, regex and comment
  literals are treated as regular javascript code and minified as such.
- Control characters inside string and regex literals are left untouched; they
  are not converted to spaces (nor to \\n)
- Newline characters are not allowed inside string and regex literals, except
  for line continuations in string literals (ECMA-5).
- "return /regex/" is recognized correctly.
- More characters are allowed before regexes.
- Line terminators after regex literals are handled more sensibly
- "+ +" and "- -" sequences are not collapsed to '++' or '--'
- Newlines before ! operators are removed more sensibly
- (Unnested) template literals are supported (ECMA-6)
- Comments starting with an exclamation mark (``!``) can be kept optionally
- rJSmin does not handle streams, but only complete strings. (However, the
  module provides a "streamy" interface).

Since most parts of the logic are handled by the regex engine it's way faster
than the original python port of ``jsmin.c`` by Baruch Even. The speed factor
varies between about 6 and 55 depending on input and python version (it gets
faster the more compressed the input already is).  Compared to the
speed-refactored python port by Dave St.Germain the performance gain is less
dramatic but still between 3 and 50 (for huge inputs). See the docs/BENCHMARKS
file for details.

rjsmin.c is a reimplementation of rjsmin.py in C and speeds it up even more.

## COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE

Copyright 2011 - 2022
André Malo or his licensors, as applicable.

The whole package (except for the files in the bench/ directory)
is distributed under the Apache License Version 2.0. You'll find a copy in the
root directory of the distribution or online at:

## SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Supported python versions are 2.7 and 3.4+.

You also need a build environment for python C extensions (i.e. a compiler
and the python development files).


## INSTALLATION

### Using pip

```
$ pip install rjsmin
```


### Using distutils

Download the package, unpack it, change into the directory

```
$ python setup.py install
```

The command above will install a new "rjsmin" package into python's
library path.


### Drop-in

rJSmin effectively consists of two files: rjsmin.py and rjsmin.c, the
latter being entirely optional. So, for simple integration you can just
copy rjsmin.py into your project and use it.


## DOCUMENTATION

The module provides a simple function, called jsmin which takes the script as
a string and returns the minified script as a string.

The module additionally provides a "streamy" interface similar to the one
jsmin.c provides:

```
$ python -mrjsmin <script >minified
```

It takes two options:

  -b  Keep bang-comments (Comments starting with an exclamation mark)
  -p  Force using the python implementation (not the C implementation)
