Changes with version 1.2.1

 *) Add support for Python 3.11

 *) Removed debug print from setup.py

 *) Update project boilerplate


Changes with version 1.2.0

 *) Improve regex detection. Fixes #17, #23

 *) Add aarch64 wheels (issue #24, #25, contributed by odidev)

 *) Add tests to source distribution (issue #20, contributed by dvzrv)

 *) bytearray input now produces bytearray output

 *) Update python support: 2.7, 3.6+

 *) Emit the correct env var name in the warning message if the compilation of
    the C implementation fails.


Changes with version 1.1.0

 *) Add support for unnested template literals (ECMA-6). Fixes #8. Kind of.

 *) Allow +, - and * in front of regexes. Fixes #13.

 *) The python version will only accept the C implementation if the versions
    match exactly. This should prevent using older installed C versions.
    Fixes #11. This issue is now more relevant since #7 is fixed.

 *) The C extension is now optional in the build process. You can make it
    required by setting the SETUP_CEXT_REQUIRED environment variable to 1.
    Fixes #7.

 *) Both python 2 and 3 now accept bytes and text as input. All other types now
    raise a TypeError. Before they possibly have been converted to a string,
    depending on the python version and the implementation.

 *) Support for PyPy and Jython is no longer tested. Patches are accepted,
    though.

 *) Minor adaptions for GCC 8

 *) Fix an inconsistency in the jsmin_for_posers function. It was not working
    properly with bang-comments enabled.

 *) Docs are no longer installed locally.

 *) Rework the setup and project management system. Add some real tests. Get rid
    of epydoc in favor of sphinx. Adapt to latest sphinx version.


Changes with version 1.0.12

 *) Benchmark updates, dropped slimit benchmarks, because of installation
    trouble

 *) Reworked handling of comments starting with exclamation marks. The matcher
    should no longer get out of sync, even if they appear in the middle of other
    matches.

 *) Handle line terminators before and after regex literals more sensible

 *) Added command line option for keeping comments starting with an exclamation
    mark (-b)

 *) Added command line option for disabling the C implemention (-p)

    Spotted by: Dave Smith <dave thesmithfam.org>

 *) Collapsion protection was reduced to "+ +" and "- -" sequences (which
    still includes longer sequences like "+ ++")


Changes with version 1.0.3

 *) "+ ++" and "- --" sequences are no longer collapsed. They were before,
    because the original jsmin collapsed them, too.

 *) Updated benchmarks, added slimit and removed jsmin v8 (because it produced
    invalid results).

 *) Removed "classic" regex variant.


Changes with version 1.0.2

 *) Although it should work, python 2.3 is no longer supported.
    (No suitable test environment)

 *) "return /regex/" is now recognized as regex expression. It wasn't before,
    because the original jsmin ignored that, too.


Changes with version 1.0.1

 *) Add C extension reimplementing the regex from rjsmin.py


Changes with version 1.0.0

 *) First stable release.
